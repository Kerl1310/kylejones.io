Business landscapes are constantly evolving around the world, with every organization clambering to innovate so that they can better react to the changing conditions in which they exist and to uncover new opportunities to help them to drive their growth and profits. But in a world where true innovation is scarce and many companies resort to rehashing the same ideas, how do you foster an environment that cultivates ideation?

Open-source software has seen it’s fair share of innovative languages, tools, frameworks and products in recent years. Some notable examples include [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) - not to mention numerous machine learning frameworks like [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). The most interesting element of this growth is the fact that a number of these open source products and tools are generating revenue like regular software development companies that do not openly publish their source code, often through hybrid licensing or hosting.

In 2014, [Digital Ocean](https://do.co) unveiled its first open-source hackathon - [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). The requirements have changed over the years but the core message has stayed the same - several contributions to public code repositories that positively impact the projects earns you a limited edition t-shirt and some stickers. Fast forward to 2020, and Hacktoberfest has grown to become a juggernaut that drives the open-source community to new heights year after year. Key metrics for the event have soared, from 768 participants in their first year to a whopping 61,871 completing the challenge in 2019 - an impressive growth of over 8,000 percent! But why has this explosive growth happened, and how does it affect businesses?

Both open-source software and hackathons encourage collaboration between a number of individuals, often rallying them around a single goal. This leads to a positive environment for a number of like-minded individuals to bounce ideas for new features or even whole new products off each other. In the case of hackathons, people are also motivated by the prospect of a reward or prize. Hacktoberfest’s offering of merchandise in return for contributions is part marketing campaign and part motivator - encouraging participation and contributions to both the event and the wider open-source community.

Over the years, a variety of well-known companies have contributed to, sponsored and supported Hacktoberfest - with notable examples ranging from [Indeed](https://www.indeed.co.uk/) to [Twilio](https://twilio.com/) to [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). A handful of these, including Indeed and [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) (who have recently been acquired by Twilio), have published papers and talks discussing their takeaways and the associated statistics from their participation in Hacktoberfest.
[Umbraco recorded a growth of 40%](https://umbraco.com/blog/pr-team-update-november-2019-hacktoberfest-round-up/) between their participation in 2018 and 2019, with the number of pull requests in 2019 coming in at 436. Most recently, Indeed [talked about the statistics from their internal Hacktoberfest events at DevRelCon Earth 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uweScYvtUts&feature=youtu.be). Between 2018 and 2019, they recorded an increase of 1,322 contributions and 170 pull requests. [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/wp-content/uploads/pdf/SendGrid-Hacktoberfest.pdf) saw the number of pull requests increase from 43 in 2016 to 1,249 in 2017, with over 1,000 of those being changes to source code. These pull requests equated to 1,385 story points of effort (around 3.4 years of work!).
