# kylejones.io

This is the source code for my personal portfolio and blog built with Gatsby, deployed using Github Actions and hosted on Github Pages.

It currently features integrations with Github, Goodreads and Spotify's APIs.
Testing is performed with Jest, although additional testing with Cypress is planned for a future release.
